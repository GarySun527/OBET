A website in Python using Flask.

It's suggested that you install a virtual environment (virtualenv), and then install
all dependencies there.

Current issue is that for some reason, the MAIL_USERNAME/PASSWORD variables cannot be read
from the environment and must be put in manually. :(

To run this app (on Linux):
$ python hello.py runserver -dr

To test on the command line (also on Linux):
$ python hello.py shell

When using on the command line, the app, db, User, Lit, and Role are already imported.
